description: The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (or, more briefly,
  Tristram Shandy) is a novel by Laurence Sterne. It was published in nine volumes,
  the first two appearing in 1759, and seven others following over the next 10 years.
  It was not always held in high esteem by other writers (Samuel Johnson responded
  that, "Nothing odd will do long. Tristram Shandy did not last."), but its bawdy
  humour was popular with London society, and it has come to be seen as one of the
  greatest comic novels in English, as well as a forerunner for many modern narrative
  devices.-- Excerpted from Wi.
